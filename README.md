# Cypher

A simple cypher program that uses a variation on a shift cypher.

## Important Notes:

The program has three methods. The first one simply calculates the text shift from the current date.  
The other two can be used separately. Below is some sample output of the text before and after it was encrypted.

### Original Text:
"Hello, this is a simple text"

### Encrypted Text:
"Pm tt w4 (| pq {( q{ (i ({ iu xt m( |m Â€|"
